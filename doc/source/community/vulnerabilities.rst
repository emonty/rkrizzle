Vulnerability Disclosure
========================

If you think you have found a potential security vulnerability in requests,
please open a private/security bug at `https://bugs.launchpad.net/rkrizzle`_.
**Do not file a public issue.**

If English is not your first language, please try to describe the problem and
its impact to the best of your ability. For greater detail, please use your
native language and we will try our best to translate it using online services.

Please also include the code you used to find the problem and the shortest
amount of code necessary to reproduce it.

Please do not disclose this to anyone else. We will retrieve a CVE identifier
if necessary and give you full credit under whatever name or alias you provide.
We will only request an identifier when we have a fix and can publish it in a
release.

We will respect your privacy and will only publicize your involvement if you
grant us permission.
