Development Philosophy
======================

Rkrizzle is an open but opinionated library, created by an open but opinionated
developer who works in an open and egalitarian project.


Management Style
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rkrizzle is run like an OpenStack project and uses the OpenStack development
resources, but is not an official OpenStack project. This means we operate
like an OpenStack project beause we like it, not because we have to.

This means that the we is more important than the me. There are no BDFLs - it
turns out some of us are quite philosophically against the idea of associating
the words 'benevolent' and 'dictator' as if the two concepts could ever be
sanely combined. A dictatorship is an autocracy and as such is necessarily
oppressive. While it is true that sometimes autocrats can operate with a
higher level of efficiency (in real life generally due to the fact that they
can kill their opposition with impunity) there is more to life than efficiency.
Most notably, freedom and respect come to mind.

Values
~~~~~~

- Simplicity is better than functionality.
- Listen to everyone, then use considered judgment.
- The API matters.
- Security matters. This is a fundamental HTTP library.
- Fit the 90% use-case. It's ok to not solve everyone's usecase.

Semantic Versioning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Requests uses `Linux/Python Compatible Semantic Versioning`_ as implemented by
`PBR`_. Uness you are a version geek, it's pretty much the same as
`Semantic Versioning`_ except it doesn't break compatibility with distro
versioning schemes, and provides some mechanisms for people who need to run
continuous delivery from master rather than strictly from releases.
