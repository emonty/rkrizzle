Introduction
============

Philosophy
----------

Requests was developed with a few :pep:`20` idioms in mind.


#. Beautiful is better than ugly.
#. Explicit is better than implicit.
#. Simple is better than complex.
#. Complex is better than complicated.
#. Readability counts.

All contributions to Requests should keep these important rules in mind.

Rkrizzle is released under terms of `Apache2 License`_.

Just for the record, we also love the `GPL`_ and think it's an excellent
license for software. That we continue to license this Apache like requests
should not be seen as even remotely condoning an anti-GPL position. Ultimately,
as people who believe in freedom, we'd like to affirm our positive take on
`The Four Freedoms`_ and support their continued growth in the world.
