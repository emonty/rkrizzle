Installation
============

This part of the documentation covers the installation of Requests.
The first step to using any software package is getting it properly installed.


Distribute & Pip
----------------

Installing Rkrizzle is simple with `pip <https://pip.pypa.io>`_, just run
this in your terminal::

    $ pip install rkrizzle

or, with `easy_install <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_::

    $ easy_install rkrizzle

But, you really `shouldn't do that <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3220404/why-use-pip-over-easy-install>`_.


Get the Code
------------

Rkeizzle is actively developed on the OpenStack infrastructure, where the code
is `always available <https://git.openstack.org/openstack/rkrizzle>`_.

You can either clone the public repository::

    $ git https://git.openstack.org/openstack/rkrizzle
